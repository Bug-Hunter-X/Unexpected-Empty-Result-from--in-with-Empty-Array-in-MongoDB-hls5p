# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The query unexpectedly returns no results, even when the field exists in the documents. The solution shows how to correctly handle this scenario.

## Bug
The `$in` operator with an empty array does not correctly return documents.  This can cause logic errors when the query is used in a part of a larger application.

## Solution
The solution involves modifying the query to explicitly handle the case where the input array is empty.  This ensures that the query behaves as expected and does not unexpectedly return no results.
